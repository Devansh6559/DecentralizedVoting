🗳️ Decentralized Voting System
📌 Project Description
The Decentralized Voting System is a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to vote on proposals in a secure and transparent manner. It ensures that each user can vote only once, and only the admin can add proposals or end the voting process.

🎯 Project Vision
To create a transparent, immutable, and censorship-resistant voting mechanism that eliminates centralized control and fosters trust among participants in decentralized decision-making.

🚀 Key Features
Admin can create proposals.

Public voting on proposals, with one vote per address.

Voting is restricted to an active period controlled by the admin.

Emits events for proposal creation, voting, and voting conclusion.

Ensures tamper-proof records of votes via blockchain.

🌱 Future Scope
Allow proposal creators other than the admin.

Add time-bound voting windows using block timestamps.

Enable vote delegation and weighting.

Implement zero-knowledge proof-based anonymous voting.

Create a front-end interface with live vote tracking.
